*Let's reproduce what we learn from [try R chapter 7](http://tryr.codeschool.com/levels/7/challenges/)*


So far, we've been working purely in the abstract. It's time to take a look at some real data, and see if we can make any observations about it.


### Some Real World Data
Modern pirates plunder software, not silver. We have a file with the software piracy rate, sorted by country. Here's a sample of its format:



We'll load that into the piracy data frame for you:
```{r Q1-1, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
piracy <- read.csv("piracy.csv")
head(piracy)
```

We also have another file with GDP per capita for each country (wealth produced, divided by population):


That will go into the gdp frame:

```{r Q1-2, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
gdp <- read.table("gdp.txt",sep="\t",header=TRUE)
```
```{r}
countries <- merge(x = gdp, y = piracy)
countries
```

We'll merge the frames on the country names:
```{r Q1-3, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
countries <- merge(x = gdp, y = piracy)
```

Let's do a plot of GDP versus piracy. Call the plot function, using the "GDP" column of countries for the horizontal axis, and the "Piracy" column for the vertical axis:
```{r Q1-4, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
plot(countries$GDP, countries$Piracy)
```

It looks like there's a negative correlation between wealth and piracy - generally, the higher a nation's GDP, the lower the percentage of software installed that's pirated. But do we have enough data to support this connection? Is there really a connection at all?

R can test for correlation between two vectors with the cor.test function. Try calling it on the GDP and Piracy columns of the countries data frame:
```{r Q1-5, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
cor.test(countries$GDP, countries$Piracy)
```

The key result we're interested in is the "p-value". Conventionally, any correlation with a p-value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant, and this sample data's p-value is definitely below that threshold. In other words, yes, these data do show a statistically significant negative correlation between GDP and software piracy.

We have more countries represented in our GDP data than we do our piracy rate data. If we know a country's GDP, can we use that to estimate its piracy rate?

We can, if we calculate the linear model that best represents all our data points (with a certain degree of error). The lm function takes a model formula, which is represented by a response variable (piracy rate), a tilde character (~), and a predictor variable (GDP). (Note that the response variable comes first.)

Try calculating the linear model for piracy rate by GDP, and assign it to the line variable:

```{r Q1-6, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
line <- lm(countries$Piracy ~ countries$GDP)
```

You can draw the line on the plot by passing it to the abline function. Try it now:
```{r Q1-7, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
countries <- merge(x = gdp, y = piracy)
countries
plot(countries$GDP, countries$Piracy)
line <- lm(countries$Piracy ~ countries$GDP)
abline(line)
```



### ggplot2
The functionality we've shown you so far is all included with R by default. (And it's pretty powerful, isn't it?) But in case the default installation doesn't include that function you need, there are still more libraries available on the servers of the Comprehensive R Archive Network, or CRAN. They can add anything from new statistical functions to better graphics capabilities. Better yet, installing any of them is just a command away.

Let's install the popular **ggplot2** graphics package. Call the **install.packages** function with the package name in a string:

```{r Q2-1, echo=TRUE, results='asis',eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

You can get help for a package by calling the help function and passing the package name in the package argument. Try displaying help for the "ggplot2" package:
```{r Q2-2, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
help(package = "ggplot2")
```

Here's a quick demo of the power you've just added to R. To use it, let's revisit some data from a previous chapter.
```{r Q2-3, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
weights <- c(300, 200, 100, 250, 150)
prices <- c(9000, 5000, 12000, 7500, 18000)
chests <- c('gold', 'silver', 'gems', 'gold', 'gems')
types <- factor(chests)
```

The qplot function is a commonly-used part of ggplot2. We'll pass the weights and values of our cargo to it, using the chest types vector for the color argument:
```{r Q2-4, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(weights, prices, color = types)
```
